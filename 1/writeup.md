## 1. Using ssh, log into the remote system titaniconquirin.is-a-geek.org
I logged into the remote system.
```

naalexeev@titanic:~ $ 
```

## 2. On that system find out

### a. how many users are logged in concurrently with you

I ran users.
```
naalexeev@titanic:~ $ users
amwilliams24 enfasoformoso enfasoformoso jfrippe mddimatulac naalexeev
```
### b. how long the system is already running since last rebooted

I used uptime.
```
naalexeev@titanic:~ $ uptime
 11:18:10 up 5 days, 22:46,  6 users,  load average: 0.08, 0.06, 0.01
```
### c. what processors it has

I read the file /proc/cpuinfo. The server has a ARMv7 processor
```
naalexeev@titanic:~ $ cat /proc/cpuinfo

```


### d. how much RAM is available.

I ran the program free. The program has 2.5 Gibibyte free.
```
naalexeev@titanic:~ $ free -h
              total        used        free      shared  buff/cache   available
Mem:          3.8Gi       299Mi       2.5Gi       128Mi       1.0Gi       3.3Gi
Swap:          99Mi          0B        99Mi
```
## 3. Copy the file nanpa, found in the home directory of the clauteruser, to your account or use scp to copythe file back home onto your private computer.

I used cp to copy the file.
```
naalexeev@titanic:~ $ cp /home/clauter/nanpa ~/napa
```

## 4. On titanic or  a  private  Linux  installation,  open  the  file nanpa using less.   The  file  contains  quite  acomprehensive list of North American phone number prefixes (first 6 digits, excluding+1), followed by thelocation this phone number prefix is attached to.  For example, for 907519, the location Anchorage AKislisted. Still insideless, find the entries for 907519,503526 and a couple of other phone numbers you knowin the country, as such your home phone, your parentsâ€™ phone, the phone of a loved one etc.

## 5. Find  out  how  many  lines  connecting  prefixes  to  locations  are  contained  in  the  filenanpa.   Which  Linuxcommand line tool do you use to count lines?

## 6. List the first 17 lines of the nanpa file on command line. Also list the last 42 lines of the file. You can use the Linux tools head and tailfor this task.

## 7. Write a short bash script findlocation that takes a 6-digit prefix in argument and displays the correspond-ing location. If the script receives no argument or the argument is not a6-digit prefix made only out of the digits 0 thru 9, the script must return an exit condition code signaling failure (e.g.  by executingexit 1).  If thescript receives a correctly formatted argument but the prefix is not found in the nanpa file, the script must returnan exit condition code signaling failure. Otherwise, the script must display the appropriate location (on stdout).The location must not be prefixed by the prefix nor followed by superfluous spaces.  This means you have to format the line found thenanpafile before displaying it. You may use grep and sed for this script.

# 3. Rewrite head and tail

# 4. File Searching
